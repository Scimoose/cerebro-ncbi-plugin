# cerebro-ncbi-plugin

Hi!
This is my first ever plugin. I might update it later.
It's based on the <a href="https://github.com/KELiON/cerebro-google">cerebro-google</a> plugin, you can find it in the <a href="https://github.com/KELiON/cerebro">cerebro</a> plugin examples.
I hope it helps someone!

# Cerebro in 2019

<a href="https://github.com/KELiON/cerebro">Cerebro</a> seems to be discontinued and the latest version (0.3.2) is broken for many people. If you want to try out the plugin, please install the 0.3.1 version
